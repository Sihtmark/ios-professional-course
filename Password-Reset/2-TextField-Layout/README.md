# Text Field Layout

## Challenge

- How would you lay this out?
- Go over elements of the view, ask students to think about the auto layout, and come up with their own design on how they would do this.

## New project

- Create a new UIKit project called `Password`

## Creating the PasswordTextField view

- Everything in UIKit is a view
- So we are going to make our own for this control here
- And then stick it into a stack view on the main page.

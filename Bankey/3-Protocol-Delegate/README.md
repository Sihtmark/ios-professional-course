# Protocol-Delegate

- In this section you are going to learn not only learn what protocol-delegate is and how it works
 - you are also going to see how we can leverage its power ourselves when building UIKit applications
- We will start by first reviewing what the protocol-delegate is and how it works, then we'll shift gears and use it in our app for handling signin and onboarding

 2. Onboarding

OK, so now that you've seen how protocol-delegate works, let's head over to the arcade, and see how we can use itto signal to our `AppDelegate` that login and onboarding are done, and then ultimately aid us in our navigation.
 
## Protocol-Delegate Login

First lets define the protocol and delegate.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
protocol LoginViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
//    func didLogin(_ sender: LoginViewController) //  in you need to pass data back
    func didLogin()
}

weak var delegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate?
```

- Discuss alternative naming conventions.

Then let's use it in `AppDelgate` to signal login was complete and successful.

**AppDelegate**

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        // Display home screen
        print("foo - Did login")
    }
}
```

- Discuss
 - Extensions common way to in Swift implement `protocol` 
 -  `foo` in print statement.

Need to keep our view controllers around so we can register ourselves as the delegate.

```swift
import UIKit

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        
    let loginViewController = LoginViewController()
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
                
        loginViewController.delegate = self
        
        window?.rootViewController = loginViewController
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        // TODO: Display home screen or onboarding
        print("foo - Did login")
    }
}
```

- Discuss why `let` vs `var` on `loginViewController`

- Test it out. 
- Should now see print statement.
- Discuss how to filter print statements.
- Except it doesn't work. Because we forget to call it.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
if username == "" && password == "" {
    signInButton.configuration?.showsActivityIndicator = true
    delegate?.didLogin()
```

Run again. Now should see print statement.


## Protocol-Delegate Onboarding
 
Boss challenge - not you add it to onboarding.

Open up `OnboardingContainerViewController`. 

Go through same steps we did in login:

- Define protocol named:

```swift
didFinishOnboarding()
```

- Assign as `weak var` variable
- Call delegate when onboarding complete - `Done` button pressed or `Close` (where the `TODOs` are located).
- Then switch to `AppDelegate` - assign yourself as delegate in there.
- Implement the protocol
- Set onboarding as the `rootViewController` temporarily for testing.
- Print out statement when onboarding done.

Good luck!

**OnboardingContainerViewController**

```swift
protocol OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didFinishOnboarding()
}

var pages = [UIViewController]()
weak var delegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate?

@objc func closeTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
    
@objc func doneTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
```

**AppDelegate**

```swift
let onboardingViewController = OnboardingContainerViewController()

onboardingViewController.delegate = self
window?.rootViewController = onboardingViewController

extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        // TODO: Display home screen
        print("foo - Did onboard")
    }
}
```

OK let's test it out. Click `Next` and `Close`. Yay ðŸŽ‰!
  
## Onboard only once

Now that we have our protocol-delegate hooked up, let's us it to only onboard once.

First let's define a variable, just to temporarily

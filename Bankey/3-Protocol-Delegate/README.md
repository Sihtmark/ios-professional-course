# Protocol-Delegate

![](images/0.png)

- In this section you are going to learn not only learn what protocol-delegate is and how it works
 - you are also going to see how we can leverage its power ourselves when building UIKit applications
- We will start by first reviewing what the protocol-delegate is and how it works, then we'll shift gears and use it in our app for handling signin and onboarding

Explain what protocol-delegate is.

Explain how we are going to use it. 

OK, so now that you've seen how protocol-delegate works, let's head over to the arcade, and see how we can use it to signal to our `AppDelegate` that login and onboarding are done, and then ultimately aid us in our navigation.

## Protocol-Delegate Login

First lets define the protocol and delegate.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
protocol LoginViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
//    func didLogin(_ sender: LoginViewController) //  in you need to pass data back
    func didLogin()
}

weak var delegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate?
```

- Discuss alternative naming conventions.

Then let's use it in `AppDelgate` to signal login was complete and successful.

**AppDelegate**

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        // Display home screen
        print("foo - Did login")
    }
}
```

- Discuss
 - Extensions common way to in Swift implement `protocol` 
 -  `foo` in print statement.

Need to keep our view controllers around so we can register ourselves as the delegate.

```swift
import UIKit

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        
    let loginViewController = LoginViewController()
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
                
        loginViewController.delegate = self
        
        window?.rootViewController = loginViewController
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        // TODO: Display home screen or onboarding
        print("foo - Did login")
    }
}
```

- Discuss why `let` vs `var` on `loginViewController`

- Test it out. 
- Should now see print statement.
- Discuss how to filter print statements.
- Except it doesn't work. Because we forget to call it.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
if username == "" && password == "" {
    signInButton.configuration?.showsActivityIndicator = true
    delegate?.didLogin()
```

Run again. Now should see print statement.


## Protocol-Delegate Onboarding
 
Boss challenge - not you add it to onboarding.

Open up `OnboardingContainerViewController`. 

Go through same steps we did in login:

- Define protocol named:

```swift
didFinishOnboarding()
```

- Assign as `weak var` variable
- Call delegate when onboarding complete - `Done` button pressed or `Close` (where the `TODOs` are located).
- Then switch to `AppDelegate` - assign yourself as delegate in there.
- Implement the protocol
- Set onboarding as the `rootViewController` temporarily for testing.
- Print out statement when onboarding done.

Good luck!

**OnboardingContainerViewController**

```swift
protocol OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didFinishOnboarding()
}

var pages = [UIViewController]()
weak var delegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate?

@objc func closeTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
    
@objc func doneTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
```

**AppDelegate**

```swift
let onboardingContainerViewController = OnboardingContainerViewController()

onboardingViewController.delegate = self
window?.rootViewController = onboardingContainerViewController

extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        // TODO: Display home screen
        print("foo - Did onboard")
    }
}
```

OK let's test it out. Click `Next` and `Close`. Yay ðŸŽ‰!
  
## Transitioning smoothly like a pro

Now that we have our protocol-delegate hooked up, let's us it to only onboard once.

Let's comment back in the `loginViewController` in our `AppDelegate`.

```swift
window?.rootViewController = loginViewController
```

Then let's display onboarding when login completes.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        window?.rootViewController = onboardingContainerViewController
    }
}
```

OK now, this works. But it is a bit abrupt. It directly replaces the login with the onboarding vc on the `rootViewController` but there is no nice transition or animation. Let's fix that.

Add this method into the `AppDelegate`.

```swift
func setRootViewController(_ vc: UIViewController, animated: Bool = true) {
    guard animated, let window = self.window else {
        self.window?.rootViewController = vc
        self.window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return
    }

    window.rootViewController = vc
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    UIView.transition(with: window,
                      duration: 0.3,
                      options: .transitionCrossDissolve,
                      animations: nil,
                      completion: nil)
}
```

And replacing setting the rootViewController directly with this.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        setRootViewController(onboardingContainerViewController)
    }
}
```

- Discuss: Explain what is going on here with animation etc.

Great - so we can onboard and transition. But how can we ensure that users can only on board once.

To do that we need a home screen, or at least some place we can send people after they have logged in.

In the next session we'll see how we can 

- setup a dummy view controller to temporaily nagivate to
- give it the ability to logout
- save our state (both in memory and on disk).


## Creating a dummy for a home screen

Create new class `DummyViewController` in `Login` directory. Go ahead and type this code in.

**DummyViewController**

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let stackView = UIStackView()
    let label = UILabel()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        style()
        layout()
    }
}

extension ViewController {
    func style() {
        stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        stackView.axis = .vertical
        stackView.spacing = 20
        
        label.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        label.text = "Dummy"
        label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .title1)
    }
    
    func layout() {
        stackView.addArrangedSubview(label)
        
        view.addSubview(stackView)
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            stackView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
            stackView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor),
        ])
    }
}
```

- Discuss - create a snippet if you haven't already for this. We are going to reuse this going forward. Will save some typing.

Now let's display this dummy view controller when onboarding is done.

**AppDelegate**

```swift
extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        setRootViewController(DummyViewController())
    }
}
```

## Logging them out

Going to do this with a protocol-delegate and adding it to our `DummyViewController`.

Define the protocol in `LoginViewController`.

```swift
protocol LogoutDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didLogout()
}
```

Add a logout button and delegate to `DummyViewController`.

```swift
let logoutButton = UIButton(type: .system)

logoutButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
logoutButton.configuration = .filled()
logoutButton.setTitle("Logout", for: [])
logoutButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(logoutButtonTapped), for: .primaryActionTriggered)

@objc func logoutButtonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
    logoutDelegate?.didLogout()
}

stackView.addArrangedSubview(logoutButton)
```

Discussion

 - Explain @objc
 - Explain selector
 - Explain method signature of selector

Register for it in our `AppDelegate`.

```swift
let dummyViewController = DummyViewController()

dummyViewController.logoutDelegate = self

extension AppDelegate: LogoutDelegate {
    func didLogout() {
        // TODO: Set state
        setRootViewController(loginViewController)
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        setRootViewController(dummyViewController) // here
    }
}
```

Test it out. When we hit logout we end up back at the loging screen.

So that that we have this setup, we are in a place where we can actually try to remember whether the user has already been through the onboarding process.

Let's track this in memory.

## Tracking state in memory

Tracking in memory is he easiest thing we can do, and a good place to start. Let's create a variable representing whether someone has onboarded, and then set it when they have.

**AppDelegate**

```swift
var onboarded = false
    
extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        onboarded = true
        setRootViewController(dummyViewController)
    }
}
```

And then update our `didLogin` to leverage this logic.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        if onboarded {
            setRootViewController(dummyViewController)
        } else {
            setRootViewController(onboardingViewController)
        }
    }
}
```

If we run this now we'll see that is almost works. We just have a left over spinner that we need to reset. We can do that like this.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
    signInButton.configuration?.showsActivityIndicator = false
}
```

Test. Now everything works. Can onboard once, and never again for that session.

Now this is pretty good, but look what happens if we restart the app. It forgets.

Let's make our app permanently remember by storing this state on the phone. Using something called `UserDefaults`.

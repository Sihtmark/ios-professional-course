# Animating with constraints

When animating via Auto Layout constraints, we first setup the layout we want to animate `from`, then we modify the constraint in an animation block for where we want to animate `to`.

In this case we are going to add an animation to the login page. We'll start by placing the title and subtitle off screen, and then animate then in after the page as appeared.

First define some variables to represent the edges of our constraints.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
var password: String? {
    return loginView.passwordTextField.text
}

// animation
var leadingEdgeOnScreen: CGFloat = 16
var leadingEdgeOffScreen: CGFloat = -1000

var titleLeadingAnchor: NSLayoutConstraint?
```

Then modify the `titleLabel` constraints so we start with our title **off screen**.

```swift
// Title
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    subtitleLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalToSystemSpacingBelow: titleLabel.bottomAnchor, multiplier: 3),
    titleLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: loginView.trailingAnchor)
])
    
titleLeadingAnchor = titleLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: leadingEdgeOffScreen)
titleLeadingAnchor?.isActive = true
```

Then let's define the animation.

```swift
// MARK: - Animations
extension LoginViewController {
    private func animate() {
        let animator1 = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 0.25, curve: .easeInOut) {
            self.titleLeadingAnchor?.constant = self.leadingEdgeOnScreen
            self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
        }
        animator1.startAnimation()
    }
}
```

Run the app now. And you should see the title appear offscreen.

Now comes the fun part. Animating the title in. To do this we need to hook into the `viewDidAppear` lifecycle of the view controller. We want the auto layout to have fully completed (that's why we don't do this in `willAppear`). 

Now we want to change the constraint and trigger the animation in.

```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    animate()
}
```

What makes this all work is this line here:

```swift
self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
```

This is a signal to layout the subview immediately if any values have changed. Which they have.

If we run this now, we should see the title label animate in.

Let's save our work.

```
> git add -p
> git commit -m "feat: Animate in login title label"
```

### Challenge - Animate in the subtitle

OK your turn. Following the step we just did for title, see if you can animate in the `subtitleLabel` just like we did for `titleLabel`.

- Define the constraint
- Update the layout to grab the leading edge
- Then set in the animation block.

Solution.

```swift
var subtitleLeadingAnchor: NSLayoutConstraint?

// Subtitle
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    loginView.topAnchor.constraint(equalToSystemSpacingBelow: subtitleLabel.bottomAnchor, multiplier: 3),
    subtitleLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: loginView.trailingAnchor)
])
    
subtitleLeadingAnchor = subtitleLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: leadingEdgeOffScreen)
subtitleLeadingAnchor?.isActive = true

self.subtitleLeadingAnchor?.constant = self.leadingEdgeOnScreen
```

Demo. Cool! That works nicely. But watch what we can do with animations. We can chain them together.

Let's create a second animator and do our subitle animation in there.

```swift
let animator2 = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 0.25, curve: .easeInOut) {
    self.subtitleLeadingAnchor?.constant = self.leadingEdgeOnScreen
    self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
}
animator2.startAnimation(afterDelay: 0.25)
```

Save your work.

```
> git add -p
> git commit -m "feat: Add separate animation for subtitle label"
```


## ðŸª² Debugging

If you ever want to see your animations in slow motion, select your simulator and go:

`Debug > Slow Animations`

## Playing with visibility and alpha

One common technique for making controls appear and fade is to play with this visibility and alpha.

For example we could set our titles `alpha` to `0`

```swift
titleLabel.alpha = 0
```

Run and demo. Now the label is effectively hidden.

But we can bring it back by resetting `alpha` back to a default of `1` in our animation.

```swift
// MARK: - Animations
extension LoginViewController {
    private func animate() {
        let duration = 0.8
        
        let animator1 = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: duration, curve: .easeInOut) {
            self.titleLeadingAnchor?.constant = self.leadingEdgeOnScreen
            self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
        }
        animator1.startAnimation()
        
        let animator2 = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: duration, curve: .easeInOut) {
            self.subtitleLeadingAnchor?.constant = self.leadingEdgeOnScreen
            self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
        }
        animator2.startAnimation(afterDelay: 0.2)
        
        let animator3 = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: duration*2, curve: .easeInOut) {
            self.titleLabel.alpha = 1
            self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
        }
        animator3.startAnimation(afterDelay: 0.2)
    }
}
```

If we run this now we should see a nice animation fade in.


### Challenge: Fade in subtitle label

See if you can fade in our `subtitleLabel`. Follow the steps we did for `titleLabel`.

- Set the alpha to `0`.
- Add it to the correct animation block.
- And see if you can make it fade in just like the `title`.

Solution

```swift
subtitleLabel.alpha = 0
```

```swift
self.subtitleLabel.alpha = 1
```

Save your work.

```
> git add -p
> git commit -m "feat: Add fade in animation to login titles"
> git push
```

### Recap what we have done here

- Used constraints as a means of animating
- Step 1 was setting up the constratints into a position we wanted to animate from
- Step 2 was creating animation blocks using `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to animate to by adjusting constraints and setting values on our controls.

Next we are going to drop down a layer and take a look at `Core Animation` libary and see how we can do even more power animations that aren't easily replicated in UIKit.
